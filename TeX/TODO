(0) Give as much details as are available on the model producing the simulated
data.
(1) Describe the location of the time series that was used for Eric and Cody's
analysis (where, what vegetation, etc.).
(2) Compute the zeros of the AR(4) process you fitted to the detrended data. Are
they complex-valued pairs? (Is the AR mimicking the cyclical behavior?)
(3) For the change-point analysis, redo the testing on the subsamples obtained
from splitting at the estimated change-point (note: multiple testing).
(4) For the spatial part, plot the overall spatial mean function. Try to
interpret the effects of the spacial principal components. 
(5) How do the residuals look after you regress out the dominant annual cycles
from the principal component score series? Are they white noise or is there
more?
